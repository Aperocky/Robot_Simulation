Run the Main class with variables m and n

The pathfinding algorithms are in Robots.class and Mathfunc.class, respectively.

The pathfinding algorithms have been very efficient in finding targets.

The Jar file is built, and takes in either 2 arguments or 3 arguments or 4 arguments:

They are (m, n, radius, filename). If you don't want to specify a filename for your log file, then it will go to records.log, the log file will be overwritten each time if it's not new.

The default values are m = 3, n = 6, radius = 100 and filename = "records.log"

The simulation runs 20 games each and put out an average number of detection averaged over 120 secs and 20 simulations. 

The log file only contains the record of the first game -> In the log file the position and speed of each robot and target are given --> I don't really want to write huge log files.

Explore yourself! 

Best.
Rocky.
